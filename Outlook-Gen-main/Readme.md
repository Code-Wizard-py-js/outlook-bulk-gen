## What is OUTLOOK?
Outlook is a popular email client and personal information manager developed by Microsoft. It is primarily used to manage email, contacts, and calendars, but also includes features such as task management, note-taking, and journaling. Outlook can be used as a standalone application or can be integrated with other Microsoft Office products such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Outlook supports multiple email accounts, including webmail services such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail, and can be used to manage both personal and professional email. In addition to email management, Outlook allows users to create and manage appointments and meetings, set reminders, and view multiple calendars.

Outlook is available for Windows and Mac OS, and also has a web-based version known as Outlook on the web, which allows users to access their email, contacts, and calendars from any web-enabled device.
